# Coordinates

## Getting Started

To use the code contained within this repository for your own purposes, you must modify the body of the *main.cpp* file to perform the operations you want to customize. However, I have included a *testCoordinates.cpp* file which contains tests for each class to ensure functionality of the code. To execute the *testCoordinates.cpp* file you must input the following into your bash terminal:

```bash
g++ -std=c++20 -Wall testCoordinates.cpp -o testCoordinates
```

You can also customize your compilation by changing the C++ standard (i.e., 11, 17, etc...), and you can define the output directory using an aboslute path concluding with the name of the executable. Once you have successfully compiled the code, you can run the executable as follows:

```bash
./testCoordinates
```
